Authorize.net AJAX Component
============================

This is a PHP component that is called via AJAX to submit a request to Authorize.net and report back its success status. It was used in an event registration system that was implemented on several client websites. It also includes logic to render the user's "finish later" token useless (but still remember that it has been assigneD) if the transaction is processed successfully.
